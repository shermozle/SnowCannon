# SnowCannon

## Introduction

SnowCannon is a Node.js web analytics data collection server for [SnowPlow] [snowplow], by Simon Rumble <simon@simonrumble.com>.

There are two benefits of using SnowCannon over SnowPlow's existing CloudFront-based collector:

1. Allows use of a third-party cookie, making tracking across domains possible for all except mobile Safari. This is something even the Google Analytics JS-set cookies approach struggles with
2. Enables real-time analytics, if you want it. CloudFront has 10-20 minute delays to get the logs into S3

## How SnowCannon works

In a nutshell: SnowCannon receives events from the [SnowPlow JavaScript tracker] [snowplow-js], sets/updates a third-party user tracking cookie, and logs the events in gzipped files to Amazon S3.

In pseudocode terms:

	if (request contains an "sp" cookie) {
	    Record that cookie as the user identifier
	    Set that cookie with a now+1 year cookie expiry
	    Add the headers and payload to the output array
	} else {
	    Set the "sp" cookie with a now+1 year cookie expiry
	    Add the headers and payload to the output array
	}
	Every 10 minutes, push the data out to S3 as a gzipped JSON file

## Dependencies

SnowCannon depends on the following NPM packages:

* [knox] [knox], an Amazon S3 library
* [node-uuid] [node-uuid], generates UUIDs for user tracking
* [measured] [measured], for server status monitoring

## Getting started

First, you need to [install Node.js] [node-install].

Next, install the dependent modules:

    $ npm install knox node-uuid measured

And finally run it:

    $ node snowcannon.js

If you are using the default HTTP port 80, you may need to run node using `sudo` (and potentially the full path to your node binary).

## Testing

You can run a manual check on SnowCannon by loading the following web page in your web browser:

    tests/manual/async.html

To check this is working:

1. Use e.g. Chrome Developer Tools to check that `ice.png` is being successfully fetched from your SnowCannon instance running on `http://localhost`.
2. Check that your events are being printed to `stdout` in your terminal running SnowCannon

## Configuring your event sink

SnowCannon currently supports two different event sinks:

1. **stdout** - where events (and only events) are printed to `stdout`. You can then use your process control system (e.g. supervisord or daemontools) to handle the `stdout` eventstream (e.g. uploading it to S3 or Google Storage). This sink is also useful for debugging
2. **s3** - where events are collected by SnowCannon, and then regularly gzipped and uploaded to S3 by SnowCannon itself

Another event sink planned (but not yet implemented) is [Fluentd] [fluentd] - where Fluentd will be responsible for uploading the events to S3, Google Storage or equivalent.

You can configure your event sink in the `config.js` file. By default the event sink is set to **stdout**. To change it to **s3**, please set the `config.sink.out` variable like so:

```javascript
config.sink.out = "s3";
```

And then update the following configuration section:

```javascript
// S3 bucket name
config.sink.s3.bucket = 'S3 BUCKET NAME GOES HERE';

// AWS access details
config.sink.s3.key = process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID || 'KEY GOES HERE IF ENV NOT SET';
config.sink.s3.secret = process.env.AWS_SECRET_KEY || 'SECRET GOES HERE IF ENV NOT SET';
```

Note that you do not have to add your AWS access details into this file if they are already available to node.js in your shell environment.

## Performance

Tested on an Amazon EC2 Small with Siege, SnowCannon handles up to about 10,000 concurrent requests a second before it starts dropping connections.

## Roadmap

* Update the output format (turn it into JSON)
* Add Fluentd event sink support
* Work on supporting infrastructure of auto-scaling and load balancing
